# WAwesome!

**HERE LIES VAPORWARE! THIS CODE DOESN'T ANYTHING USEFUL, AND MIGHT EVEN DO THAT INCORRECTLY. PUT YOUR MONEY IN ETFs INSTEAD.**

WAwesome is (well... will be) a tool for analyzing WebAssembly. It currently
parses a subset of the WebAssembly binary format into a Rust structs that it
might at some point also be able to interpret.

To run, give a WebAssembly file `MYTOY.wasm`, run:

```sh
$ cargo run < /path/to/MYTOY.wasm
```
